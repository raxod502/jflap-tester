# DEPRECATED: JFLAP Tester

This repository formerly contained a command-line script designed for
testing [NFAs][nfa] and [Turing machines][turing] created in [JFLAP].
It has been superseded in favor of the JFLAP autograding functionality
now available in [hmc-grader], which provides a complete superset of
the functionality of jflap-tester and is also more robust because it
is based on [jflap-lib].
